This a group project where I worked as a Back-end Developer (Using PHP) . Here we made a website for Tiffin service
where customers are to order their food from the website.

Here : Homepage of the website is index.html.


# HOW IT WORKS â€” SIMPLE AS 1, 2, 3

1. You can directly order your tiffin by clicking on the order now button (from 12:00-3:00p.m.)after viewing the menu or you can also register as a vendor

2. Upon ordering you will get a mail about the order details.

3. Enjoy your meal after less than 60 minutes. See you the next time!Our men will take the tiffin from you after 3:30p.m.
